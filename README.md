# Challenges
This was the second application I created and I learned a lot. Particularly, my knowledge improved regarding setting up the back-end of an application using Node.js and how to set up routes properly. Node.js was something I initially struggled with but once I implemented the npm package: 'Request,' I began to understand how to handle requests within the app.js file.  I used Bootstrap to ensure the application was responsive across mobile and desktop devices, however, in the future I would like to practice more CSS and learn other technologies, such as, SCSS to better organise my stylesheets.
